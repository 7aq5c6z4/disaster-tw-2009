= auto_html

Rails plugin for embedding rich content by converting provided URL's to appropriate HTML blocks for links, images, youtube, vimeo, google video, deezer and more.


== Synopsis

auto_html plugin is the perfect choice if you don't want to bother visitors with rich HTML editor or markup code, but you still want to allow them to embed video, images, links and more on your site, purely by pasting URL.

Let's say you have model Comment with attribute body. HTML is accessible through the body_html attribute. Now have something like this: 

  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    auto_html_for :body do
      html_escape
      image
      youtube :width => 400, :height => 250
      link :target => "_blank", :rel => "nofollow"
      simple_format
    end
  end

... and you'll have this behaviour: 

  Comment.create(:body => 'Hey check out this cool video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdsGihou8J4')  
  => #<Comment id: 123, body: 'Hey check out this cool video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdsGihou8J4', body_html: '<p>Hey check out this cool video: <object height="250" width="400"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WdsGihou8J4" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WdsGihou8J4" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="250" wmode="transparent" width="400"></embed></object></p>'>

Note that order of invoking filters is important, ie. you want html_escape as first and link amongst last, so that it doesn't transform youtube URL to plain link.


Now all you have to do is to display it in template without escaping, since plugin took care of that:

  <% for comment in @comments %>
     <li><%= comment.body_html %></li>
  <% end %>

Plugin is highly customizable, and you can easily create new filters that will transform user input any way you like. For instance, this is the filter for youtube that comes bundled with plugin:

  AutoHtml.add_filter(:image) do |text|
    text.gsub(/http:\/\/.+\.(jpg|jpeg|bmp|gif|png)(\?\S+)?/i) do |match|
      %|<img src="#{match}" alt=""/>|
    end
  end
